# Week-1
This project involves creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plastic waste images into different types. Using deep learning techniques, the model aims to improve waste sorting and recycling efforts, promoting sustainability. The repository includes all necessary code and resources for training and evaluating the model.
